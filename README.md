tox-min-req is a [tox](https://tox.wiki/) plugin that simplify the 
minimum requirements testing.

The minimum requirements is to validate if minimum requirements are 
satisfied.

To use this plugin you need to use `MIN_REQ` environment variable either in call or in `setenv` section 
of tox configuration.

## Why use this inseted of `deps` attribute of env section?

One of the possible solution is to use `deps` section in tox configuration to install dependecies in older version. 

But `deps` and package are installed in two independent steps. So it means that 
some of dependencies could be upgraded or downgraded when installing package. 

The `PIP_CONSTRAINT` variable is used to pin the dependencies. And it will apply to call of `pip install` during dependency resolving. 


## Installation

```console
pip install tox-min-req
```

## License

`tox-min-req` is distributed under the terms of the [MIT](https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html) license.


# Usage

The basic usage is to set the `MIN_REQ` environment variable to `1`

```bash
$ MIN_REQ=1 tox -e py37
```

## Configuration options

The `tox-min-req` plugin allow to provide following environment configuration options:

* `min_req` - set to `1` to enable the minimum requirements testing, could be used instead of environment variable.
* `min_req_constraints` - list of additional constrains that will be used to generate the constrains file. 
   It could be useful in following scenarios:
  * Some of dependencies in old version is incompatible with its dependencies in latest version. (see Known issues)
  * Maintainers would like to test also some problematic dependencies in old version, but not oldest supported version.

```ini
[tox]
envlist = py310

[testenv]
extras = test
recreate = True
commands = pytest test_file.py
min_req = 1
min_req_constraints=
    coverage==6.5.0
    babel==2.6.0
    six==1.14.0
    -r {project_dir}/constraints.txt
```

Please note that `-r {project_dir}/constraints.txt` will be put in generated constrains file, not parsed.

# Known issues

## Pinning only direct dependencies

As this plugin parse only `setup.cfg` or `pyproject.toml` file, it is not possible to pin the indirect dependencies.
To provide the indirect dependencies pinning, the `min_req_constraints` environment configuration option could be used.

## Space in constrains file path
`pip` is using the space as file path separator in `PIP_CONSTRAINT` variable. 
The plugin is storing the generated constrains file in the `.tox` temporary directory.
If the path to the temporary directory contains space, the `pip` will not be able to find the constrains file.

In such situation there is a need to set the `TOX_MIN_REQ_CONSTRAINTS` environment variable
to the path where constrains file could be written.

```bash
$ TOX_MIN_REQ_CONSTRAINTS=/tmp MIN_REQ=1 tox -e py37
```

It is also possible to use the `--min-req-constraints-path` command line option to set the path to the constrains file.

```bash
$ tox --min-req-constraints-path=/tmp -e py37
```
